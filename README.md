# Indian Sign Language
Technology has the power to do many things, and changing the world is one of them. And right now, there is an opportunity for us to help verbally challenged people to communicate with the common people. We recognise that technology alone cannot fix everything but technology can help bridge the gaps. This project is an effort to create solutions to address the challenges faced by verbally challenged people on a daily basis.

## Goal for this Project

The desired outcome of this project is to create an open source asset that can have measurable impact on the problem statements listed in this repository.

Project ISL(Indian Sign Language) is one of the initiatives where we are trying to give it back to the society. This is a project where developers code for a cause. With this project, we are trying to address the problems that verbally challenged(deaf and dumb) people go through every day. Verbally challenged people communicate using sign languages and the most commonly used sign language in south Asian countries is ISL(Indian Sign Language). While there are solutions using which we are recognising sign language but there are no standard solutions that are accessible to everyone. To address this problem, we are proposing Project ISL. The idea is to create a platform where verbally challenged can talk to regular people(and vice versa). Our plan is to infuse AI/ML techniques and create open and standard models that are publicly accessible for everyone to consume and perform translation from ISL to local languages in India(and vice versa).

## Problem Statements

1. Verbally challenged people don't have a standard system using which they can communicate with people that use various common languages like English.

2. People who are working on translation systems for sign languages to common languages(and vice versa) don't have standard APIs/services to consume.

3. Creating secure translation models where we don't have to worry about model poisoning, Inference, Extraction, Evasion.
